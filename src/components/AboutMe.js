          Iâ€™m Colton, and I spend a lot of time with Front-end development. Coding has taken over my
          life since I wrote my first line of code: console.log(&#34;Hello, World!&#34;). Since then
          Iâ€™ve worked hard to make the internet a better place than when I found it. Everything I
          make has the goal of making people&#39;s life easier in the vastly expanding digital age.
